# misy: toy MIDI synthesizer in Python
Bart Massey 2024

This toy synthesizer is intended to teach basics of
synthesizer-building: it is quite simple and otherwise kind
of useless.

Note that that `mido` used by this will not work with
`rtmidi`: you need `python-rtmidi`. There's a
`requirements.txt` file.

The controller name is currently hard-coded. You will likely
want to change that.
